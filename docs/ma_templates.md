# Marketing Agent Messaging Templates

Every asset anticipates three core objections—security, reliability, and ease of use—and pushes toward a single CTA (book a 15-minute pilot demo).

## 1. Email Template (Manager Audience)
```
Subject: [Team Name] can see ChatGPT Enterprise in action next week

Hi [Manager Name],

Your team keeps sensitive customer data moving every day, so we designed this pilot to show how ChatGPT Enterprise keeps that information locked down. In the session we will:
1. Show how SOC 2 controls and workspace-level permissions protect [team/tool].
2. Walk through a grounded workflow so outputs can be reviewed before sharing.
3. Share two ready-to-use prompt packs tailored to your weekly reports so nobody has to learn “AI speak.”

If we block 15 minutes next week, your analysts can leave with a draft report and a checklist for safe usage. Does [Day, Time] work? Reply “yes” and we will send the calendar hold plus security FAQ.

Thanks,
[Sender]
```

### Notes for customization
- Replace numbered list with examples tied to the audience’s workflows (finance, HR, ops, etc.).
- Link to the latest security FAQ or CRA-approved talking points.
- Use the CTA in the final paragraph only; everything above should build confidence.

## 2. Intranet Post Template (All Staff)
```
Title: Skip the AI learning curve—see ChatGPT Enterprise solve real tasks

What you get in 15 minutes:
- Security assurance: live walk-through of workspace controls and admin audit logs.
- Reliability: we demo grounded answers using your team’s documents plus CRA review tips.
- Ease of use: guided prompts, checklists, and office hours so nobody has to start from scratch.

CTA: Reserve your spot for the pilot demo (15 minutes, live or on-demand). [Insert booking link]

```

### Notes for customization
- Swap the bullet order if a specific objection (e.g., compliance) dominates the conversation.
- Keep each bullet under ~20 words so it reads well on mobile.
- If no booking tool exists, replace the CTA with “Email [contact] to grab a slot” and log responses in CRM.
